TL:DR: Rest branch includes our final product, so go to that one.

There are four branches in this project, master, dev develop and rest. The rest branch includes our final product and is the latest kind of working version of our code. Master was only pushed to by accident and includes a very old version of our code. Develop is a later version of the code from master and dev is a later version of develop. These were created throughout the development process due to various problems we had with our code and git, and we wanted to split up the work in some way.
